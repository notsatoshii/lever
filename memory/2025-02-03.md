# 2025-02-03 — Day One (Reset)

## Session Summary
- Eric reset the session, set up identity/soul/heartbeat
- Received massive ChatGPT dump with full LEVER architecture
- Updated timezone to KST (UTC+9)
- Set 24h check-ins to 11am KST (02:00 UTC)

## Notion Setup Complete
Created full knowledge base structure:

**Architecture sub-pages:**
- ⚙️ System Engines Overview (`2fcc1ccc-fbef-8118-b2a8-ef6db382948c`)
- 🔄 Happy Flow (End-to-End) (`2fcc1ccc-fbef-8119-8891-d564488e7690`)
- 📋 Borrow Fee Engine Spec (`2fcc1ccc-fbef-8176-96ac-eea8fe89be7d`)

**Research sub-pages:**
- 🆚 Competitive Analysis (`2fcc1ccc-fbef-813f-9d5a-f1449a2633b5`)
- 💰 LP Economics & Fee Structure (`2fcc1ccc-fbef-81f6-ba08-fdb7cb5f0d23`)

**Databases:**
- ⚡ Timmy Activity Tracker (Kanban) (`2fcc1ccc-fbef-81f1-a5e7-da2f95cff026`)

## Key Architecture Decisions (from ChatGPT dump)
- **Project name:** LEVER (permanently renamed from PMX)
- **Fee structure:** 0.02%/hr borrow (base), 10bps trading, 50/30/20 split (LP/Protocol/Insurance)
- **MVP scope:** 1-2 markets, 5x leverage, single LP pool
- **Five engines:** Pricing, Funding, Risk/Capital, Margin, Liquidation
- **Position Ledger:** Single source of truth for all positions
- **Hybrid architecture:** Off-chain computes/proposes, on-chain enforces/settles
- **Keepers:** Critical for liquidations, oracle updates, rate transitions

## Borrow Fee Time Decay
- Base: 0.02%/hr
- 48+ hours to resolution: normal rates
- 48→12 hours: ramps nonlinearly (M_ttR multiplier)
- Final 12 hours: accelerates sharply
- This is the primary expiry-risk pricing mechanism

## Competitive Positioning
- vs Azuro: They're liquidity rails, we're leverage engine on top
- vs Ultra Markets: They're custodial credit (5-10x fixed), we're non-custodial perps (up to 50x dynamic)
- vs GMX/Hyperliquid: Same mechanics, different underlying (they do crypto, we do prediction markets)

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Eric sent accelerator PDF but it didn't parse - need readable format
- [ ] Research more accelerators beyond Eric's list
- [ ] Organize remaining ChatGPT dump into Notion (MVP spec, OI caps, checklists)
- [ ] Set up 11am KST TG ping automation

## Eric's Preferences
- Full-time on LEVER
- Wants religious documentation in Notion
- Wants Kanban visibility into my work (DONE - tracker created)
- Wants 4h activity logs, 12h self-reviews, 24h priority alignment
- Appreciates dark/dry humor, hates fluff
- Prefers "Eric / boss / master"
- Timezone: KST (UTC+9)

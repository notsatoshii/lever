# 2026-02-04 — Notion Logging Transition

## 12h Self-Review (05:40 UTC)

### What I Did Well
- **Quick workflow adaptation:** When Eric said "logs should be on notion", immediately clarified which Notion location and updated HEARTBEAT.md
- **Structured approach:** Modified HEARTBEAT.md to use Activity Tracker database with proper page structure
- **Attempted execution:** Tried to run the 4h log immediately after updating the workflow

### What I Could Improve
- **Infrastructure checks:** Should have verified Notion API key was configured BEFORE updating the workflow
- **Blocked on basics:** Can't execute the new logging workflow because API key isn't set up
- **Missing proactive setup:** Should have checked Notion API access when the workflow was first designed

### Mistakes Made
- Updated logging workflow without verifying I had the tools to execute it
- Created a blocking dependency (missing API key) that prevents standard operations

### Lessons Learned
- **Always verify infrastructure before changing workflows** — especially when migrating from working local files to external APIs
- **Test the happy path immediately** — if I'd tried to create a test Notion page first, I'd have caught the missing API key
- **Dependencies matter** — moving from filesystem (always available) to API (needs config) introduces new failure modes

### Current Blocker
Need `NOTION_API_KEY` configured in `/opt/clawdbot.env` to execute the new Notion-based logging workflow.

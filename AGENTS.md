# AGENTS.md - Context Optimization Note

**Full operational guidelines moved to:** `.context/AGENTS.md`

**Why:** Token optimization - reduced context load for heartbeats and routine messages

**When to read .context/AGENTS.md:**
- Setting up new workflows
- Needing operational reminders
- Onboarding or major system changes
- When uncertain about protocols

**For quick reference:**
- Read `SOUL.md` for personality/voice
- Read `USER.md` for Eric's context
- Read `.context/HEARTBEAT.md` during heartbeats
- Read `.context/TOOLS.md` when using specific tools
- Read `memory/MEMORY.md` in main session only

This file stays minimal to avoid auto-loading 8KB of guidelines on every message.
